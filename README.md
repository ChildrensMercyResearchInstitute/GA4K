# Genomic answers for kids

The Childrenâ€™s Mercy Research Institute is undertaking a research initiative to build a first-of-its-kind pediatric data repository to facilitate the search for answers and novel treatments for pediatric genetic conditions. Our goal is to collect genomic data and health information for 30,000 children and their families over the next seven years, creating a database of nearly 100,000 genomes.

This repo contains high-quality long read sequencing data accompanying the analysis of first 1000+ probands and their familes (XXX et al; doi:YYY).
